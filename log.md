# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 01, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Version 1.1 for screenshot-selenium-java

**Thoughts:** Need to work on taking screenshots with spesific tags. 

**TODO:** Create method for taking screenshots with WebElements not driver.get methods.

### Day 2: January 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished todo from yesterday. Turn back to SeleniumScreenshot class.

**Thoughts:** Make it more simple is perfect for all developers, i guess.

**TODO:** Create tests for all Driver's find element methods. If all done, go for new release and FINISH YOUR README!!
